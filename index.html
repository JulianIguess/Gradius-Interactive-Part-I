An evil alien army known as the Bacterian has invaded the peaceful planet known as Gradius. Not only have they invaded this peaceful planet, but they had also invaded other planets, too. Your mission is to go through the invaded planets, destroy the Bacterian bases, and head to planet Gradius to destroy them all!</h1>
